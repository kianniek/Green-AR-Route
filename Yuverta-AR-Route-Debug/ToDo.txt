Shader?:
Animate the bounds of the floors

Placement:
Select the type of block you want to place through UI
X Maybe make the place and delete button a checkmark and cross above the block moving with it?

Let the user tap the screen and spawn the block there on the closest grid position
- Or when the user presses the add button where to spawn the block
- Maybe also pre define the layer it will be so when it is spawned it automaticly is at the right layer?


Bugs:
Fix the jittering at the edges
Fix the lines being able to be seen through the blocks from some angles
Fix the block snapping to the grid while it is out of bounds/grid
